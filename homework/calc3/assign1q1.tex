\textbf{Question 1:} Find and sketch the domain of:

\tab \textbf{a)} 
\[ f(x,y) = \frac{ln(2x+3y)}{\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}} \]
Let $g(x,y) = ln(2x+3y)$, and let $h(x,y) = \sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}$. \\
Since $g(x,y)$ is a logarithmic function,
\[ 2x+3y > 0 \rightarrow y>\frac{-2x}{3} \]
Since $h(x,y)$ is the denominator of $f(x,y)$, impose the restriction that $h(x,y) \neq 0$. Since $h(x,y)$ is a square root function,
\[1-x^2-y^2>0 \rightarrow x^2+y^2 < 1 \].
Since $f(x,y) = \frac{g(x,y)}{h(x,y)}$, the domain satisfying $f(x,y)$ is the union of the domains of $g(x,y)$ and $h(x,y)$, along with $h(x,y) \neq 0$,
\[ D(f(x,y)) = \{(x,y)|2x+3y>0\} \cap \{(x,y)|x^2+y^2 < 1\}\]
Since it was required that I sketch the domain, please see the following attached page for my sketch.
